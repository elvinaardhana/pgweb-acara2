        <p>Rafflesia arnoldii, the corpse flower, or giant padma, is a species of flowering plant in the parasitic genus
            Rafflesia. It is noted for producing the largest individual flower on Earth. It has a strong and unpleasant
            odor
            of decaying flesh. It is native to the rainforests of Sumatra and Borneo. Rafflesia arnoldii is one of the
            three
            national flowers in Indonesia, the other two being the white jasmine (Jasminum sambac) and moon orchid
            (Phalaenopsis amabilis).[7] It was officially recognized as a national "rare flower" (Indonesian: puspa
            langka)
            in Presidential Decree No. 4 in 1993.[8]
        </p>
        <p>Although Rafflesia is a vascular plant, it lacks any observable leaves, stems or even roots, and does not
            have
            chlorophyll. It lives as a holoparasite on vines of the genus Tetrastigma.[14] Similar to fungi, individuals
            grow as a mass of thread-like strands of tissue completely embedded within and in intimate contact with
            surrounding host cells from which nutrients and water are obtained. It can only be seen outside the host
            plant
            when it is ready to reproduce; the only part of Rafflesia that is identifiable as distinctly plant-like are
            the
            flowers, though even these are unusual since they attain massive proportions, have a reddish-brown
            colouration,
            and stink of rotting flesh.[15]

            The flower of Rafflesia arnoldii grows to a diameter of around one meter (3.3 feet),[2] weighing up to 11
            kilograms (24 lb).[16] These flowers emerge from very large, cabbage-like, maroon or dark brown buds
            typically
            about 30 cm (12 in) wide, but the largest (and the largest flower bud ever recorded) found at Mount Sago,
            Sumatra in May 1956 was 43 cm (17 in) in diameter.[17] Indonesian researchers often refer to the bud as a
            'knop'
            (knob).</p>

            alt="Amorphophallus titanium picture" width="350">
        <p>Amorphophallus titanum, the titan arum, is a flowering plant in the family Araceae. It has the largest
            unbranched
            inflorescence in the world. The inflorescence of the talipot palm, Corypha umbraculifera, is larger, but it
            is
            branched rather than unbranched. A. titanum is endemic to rainforests on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.

            Due to its odor, like that of a rotting corpse, the titan arum is characterized as a carrion flower, and is
            also
            known as the corpse flower or corpse plant as translated from the original Indonesian word bunga bangkai
            ('bunga
            means flower, while bangkai can be translated as corpse, cadaver, or carrion).

            The titan arum's berries arrange in a regular cylindrical form that resembles the packing of spheres inside
            a
            cylindrical confinement. Those structures are also called columnar structures or crystals.</p>

        <p>Amorphophallus gigas is a plant in the Arum family, native to Sumatra.[1][2] It resembles its near relative
            Amorphophallus titanum in having a very large spadix surrounded by a very large spathe. This inflorescence
            can
            be up to 11 ft 4 in ( 3.4 meters) in height. The tuber, a corm is second in size only to A. titanum at up to
            154
            pounds (70 kilograms) in weight.</p>
